# Twine-Minigame-1
## Devlog

I found this tutorial to be somewhat difficult to understand. The reason why I feel this way is because it never mentioned having to download twine. 
From my personal experience, I would say that I am at a comfortable level with using computers and the internet. I think it definitely does help with going through set up and tutorials.


The resource I've used to help me understand the assignments this week is the internet. I think that maybe next time, I should contact my professor about downloading twine instead of searching on the internet.
